1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
From this homework, I learned a lot, especially how to solve parsing problems. However, it has a lot of challenges to fix all of
 the given problems. I added literals and basictype() methods and created a new class, JLiteralDouble.After that, I had to
 update the seeBasic() and seeRefrence() functions to check for some errors. while creating double-type variables. Then I added
 the handling assignment operator and conditionalOrExpression().This method is used to read conditionals and operations. I also
 connected them by || and retuned JLogicalOrOp object; also for JconditionalExpression, which used to check the question token,
 and if it was there,calls assignmentExpression(), and then creates a JconditionlExpession object. When determining whether a block
 is an instance block or a static block, the parser checks for left curly brackets in the class body and verify
  if a left curly bracket appears after the static token when a static block is encountered. JStaticInstanceBlock objects are
  created in accordance with the block type encountered.Additionally, the project allows for flexibility in class initialization and
   execution when loading classes, as well as handling static and instance blocks. Furthermore, the improvement in type-checking methods
   prevents errors and improves the compiler's reliability by properly handling double-types.

My homework was based on what we learned in class, and I modified Parser.
