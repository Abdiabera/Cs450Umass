1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

This project was very interesting and I learned a lot. In this project, I modified j--.jj This allowed us to create the scanner
and parser classes by program.According to the instructions, I started with the easy element of my project,
which used to handle double basic types and double literals.After that, I inserted the "LONG" token into my
reserved list.Then I updated line({type = type.LONG) also the same for DOUBLE. After I did that,
now, the Javacc parser can handle the long basic types and others.
Also, I added three other methods: interfaceMembedecl, interfacedeclaration,
and interfacebody.Also in the type declaration method, I added Lookhead; this allowed us to recognize interface
declarations or class declarations.Also I added if statement, forinitial() and forupdate(), and again I added
"for" in the loop statement. I was making sure which token needs to be checked for each steps first then the rest.
In general, this homework was very helpul to learn more about j--.jj how it works and how it handles the tokens.
