# cs450 Compiler

Description:
This course is an introduction to compiler organization and implementation, including formal specifications and algorithms for lexical and syntactic analysis, internal representation of the source program, semantic analysis, run-time environment issues, and code generation. Participants write a compiler for a reasonably large subset of a contemporary language, targeted to a virtual machine.

## About Me

I am currently a senior at UMass Boston, majoring in Computer Science. My academic interests include the theory and implementation of programming languages, distributed systems, and the design of secure, user-friendly web applications.  
Through my coursework and personal projects, I have developed skills in Python, Java, JavaScript, web frameworks, database systems, and cloud technologies. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and turning ideas into working software that can be used and improved by others.

This portfolio highlights five key projects which demonstrate my growth as a developer and my ability to apply academic knowledge to real-world problems.

## Project 1: MiniLang – High-Level Language Interpreter (CS450)

### Overview

**MiniLang** is a miniature interpreter for a custom-designed high-level programming language, built as the capstone project for CS450: *The Structure of Higher Level Languages* at UMass Boston. CS450 focuses on the syntax and semantics of high-level languages, giving students hands-on experience with parsing, parameter passing, scoping, dynamic storage allocation, and message passing.

### Objectives

- Design a readable, expressive language grammar.
- Implement a parser using recursive descent methods.
- Model and demonstrate parameter passing (by value and by reference).
- Support both static (lexical) and dynamic variable scoping.
- Simulate dynamic storage allocation with a heap and garbage collection.
- Enable object-oriented message passing.

### Implementation

- **Language Syntax:** MiniLang supports variable declarations, control flow, function definitions, and simple OOP constructs.
- **Parsing:** Built a recursive descent parser in Python that converts source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- **Parameter Passing:** Functions allow both call-by-value (default) and call-by-reference (with `ref` keyword).
- **Scoping:** The interpreter can toggle between static and dynamic scoping to illustrate both methods.
- **Dynamic Storage:** Variables and objects are allocated on a simulated heap. A basic mark-and-sweep garbage collector reclaims unused memory.
- **Message Passing:** Objects can send and receive messages (method calls), demonstrating encapsulation and dynamic dispatch.

#### Example Code

```mini
var x = 10;
function double(ref y) {
    y = y * 2;
}
double(x);
print(x); // Output: 20 (call-by-reference)

object Counter {
    var count = 0;
    function inc() { count = count + 1; }
    function get() { return count; }
}
Counter.inc();
print(Counter.get()); // Output: 1
```

### Testing & Results

- **Unit Tests:** Developed for the lexer, parser, and interpreter modules.
- **Integration Tests:** Ran full programs with mixed features to verify correct behavior.
- **User Testing:** Peers wrote sample programs to test edge cases and provide feedback.
- **Documentation:** Created a user manual and technical guide.

### Learning Outcomes

- Deepened understanding of how high-level languages work “under the hood.”
- Learned to implement parsing algorithms and manage scope and memory.
- Gained experience in interpreter construction and debugging.

- **Features:**
  - Answers FAQs about campus facilities, academic calendars, and events.
  - Can recommend courses, direct to departments, and give directions.
  - Integrates with Google Maps API for navigation.
  - Supports both text and voice input.

### Testing & Results

- Tested with 200+ sample queries from students and staff.
- Achieved >90% accuracy in returning relevant answers for covered topics.
- Positive feedback for ease of use and time saved by users.

### Learning Outcomes

- Gained practical skills in NLP, RESTful API design, and frontend-backend integration.
- Learned about data privacy and security for user interactions.

## Project 3: BookShare – Peer-to-Peer Book Exchange Platform

### Overview

**BookShare** is a web application that enables students to lend, borrow, or trade textbooks and course materials with fellow students, helping to reduce costs and promote resource sharing.

### Objectives

- Create a secure platform for users to list and search for books.
- Implement user authentication and messaging.
- Design a rating and review system for trust and accountability.

### Implementation

- **Frontend:** React.js for a responsive, single-page application.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for API endpoints.
- **Database:** MongoDB for user and book data.
- **Features:**
  - User registration and login.
  - List books for lending, borrowing, or sale.
  - Search and filter by course, author, or book title.
  - Internal messaging system for negotiations.
  - Ratings and reviews for users after transactions.

### Testing & Results

- Beta tested with 30 students over two weeks.
- Processed 50+ book exchanges with high user satisfaction.
- Identified and patched minor security vulnerabilities in messaging.
